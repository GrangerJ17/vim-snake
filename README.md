# VIM Snake

Classic snake game with a twist. Use h, j, k and l to move the snake, just like vim. 

I inititally thought I was super original for thinking of this idea on my own until I googled "vim snake" and realised I was far from the first to think of this.

The reason for making this game is to get comfortable with the principles of OOP through game development and design.

(Project on pause for now due to uni class schedule, as I want to take my time with this and properly learn OOP principles through Java. Very minimal progress made but will add more as schedule frees up).
